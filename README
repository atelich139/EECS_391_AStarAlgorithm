This is an assignment for the class EECS 391: Artifical Intelligence. 

    In this assignment, our group of three had to implement an AStar search algorithm for a game scenario where an agent had to navigate
a game board.

    My Role in this Assignment:
    - Created skeleton for how we implemented our AStar algorithm.
    - Delegated takes to each group member
        - Daniel: Wrote the AStarNode class which stores the data for each square of the game board.
        - Patrick: Wrote the GameMap class which cached the game map. Allowed us to read and perform updates to the game map. 
        - Alexander (Myself): Wrote the AStar algorithm. Helped with some areas of the other classes. Implemented the 
          technique to optimize run time by expanding the neighbors of the node by their relation to the quadrant that the goal was in.
