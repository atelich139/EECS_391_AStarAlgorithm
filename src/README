Programming Assignment 1

Resource Collection Agent Changes:



Combat Agent Changes:
Currently, we have made a MyCombatAgent class with a combat agent that attacks nearby enemies and otherwise attacks the
enemy that has ID = 0. This combat agent comes with a method called isInRange that takes in the StateView, primary id,
and second id for the units. It returns a boolean based on whether or not the primary unit is in range to attack the
secondary unit. In the middleStep of the combat agent, the player checks for each unit whether or not there is an enemy
agent in range and if so, it will attack that enemy. Also, the combat agent has a public static field that holds the id
of the unit attacked last so that multiple player units can simultaneously target the same enemy if in range.
If no enemy is in range, then the agent just compound attacks the enemy with ID = 0.

Currently, one bug in the combat agent is that it compound attacks enemy with ID = 0 and also sometimes the agent does
not seem to recognize an enemy in range, which is either because it is targeting the enemy with ID = 0 or it is targetin
the last-attacked enemy for some reason.
